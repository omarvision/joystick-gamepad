Reading a joystick in Unity takes 2 things: input manager mappings, and the Input class. You need to know the input mappings for the controller you are using. The XBox360 and Logitech F310 gamepad share the same mappings. Once you set the mapping settings in the input manager you can read the joystick using the Unity Input class.
